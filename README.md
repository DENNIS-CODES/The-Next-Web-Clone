# The-Next-Web-Clone
This project was built to practice responsive design by building a clone of thenextweb.com webpage as part of The Odin Project.

CSS grid, flexbox, and media queries were used extensively throughout this project. 

Try resizing the viewport on desktop to test the site's responsiveness.
